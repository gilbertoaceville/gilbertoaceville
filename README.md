### Hi there 👋


Hi there 👋😁
I'm Gilbert James, and I am a software engineer, 60% of the time into Front end engineering.

I've been in the internet and web services for 4 years and I understand how important it is to reach a target audience with the cutting edge technologies available today 🚀. 

I spend most of my time coding 👨🏽‍💻 and when I am not, I surfing the internet or learning about a new tech feature most especially front end technologies🚀.

Although I've alternated between the front-end and back-end development duties, I've achieved much by applying the latest technology application trends to maintain and manage applications. Let's develop a win-win situation together 😉.
